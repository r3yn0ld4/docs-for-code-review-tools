Pattern: Redshift cluster should be deployed into a specific VPC

Issue: -

## Description

Redshift clusters that are created without subnet details will be created in EC2 classic mode, meaning that they will be outside of a known VPC and running in tennant.

In order to benefit from the additional security features achieved with using an owned VPC, the subnet should be set.

**Resolution**: Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "bad_example" {
	cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
	database_name      = "mydb"
	master_username    = "foo"
	master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
	node_type          = "dc1.large"
	cluster_type       = "single-node"
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "good_example" {
	cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
	database_name      = "mydb"
	master_username    = "foo"
	master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
	node_type          = "dc1.large"
	cluster_type       = "single-node"

	cluster_subnet_group_name = "redshift_subnet"
}
```
